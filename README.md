# UCB-APIs-Project
I created a weather map across world (500+) cities.The Python script utilizes python library, citypy, makes API calls to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data. 
Then I created hotel search by taking taking inputs from the user and creating the database based on their choice of max and min temperatues. 
In the last section a driving route was developed between 4 cities that meet the user creteria of max and min temerature.
